# Course Prerequisites Visualizer

A React app to visualize and manage course prerequisites.

It's very buggy! I don't know React :cry And I couldn't get the elk.js stuff to work for edge routing to minimize overlaps for complex graphs. Please feel free to help improve it. I also haven't combed through the code yet for any mistakes, gonna do that at some point. I just wanted this to plan out the order of my summer study of chemistry, biology, and physics. If you want to help make this more viable / user friendly / add more functionality / fix bugs feel free to request to contribue! It'd be lovely if you contributed to this rather than forking.
