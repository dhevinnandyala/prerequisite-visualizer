# PrereqTree

> Interactive web application for visualizing course prerequisites as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

## About

PrereqTree is a free, open-source tool that helps students and educators visualize course prerequisites in an interactive skill-tree style graph. Users can create courses, define prerequisite relationships, and see the full dependency chain laid out automatically using dagre graph layout.

## Features

- Add courses and define prerequisite relationships between them
- Automatic DAG layout with interactive graph visualization (pan, zoom, drag)
- Multiple workspaces to organize different course plans
- Color themes (Ocean, Sunset, Forest) with dark mode support
- Import/export workspaces as JSON files (with drag-and-drop support)
- Circular dependency detection to prevent invalid prerequisite chains
- All data stored locally in the browser (no account or server required)

## Tech Stack

- React 19, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS v4
- React Flow (@xyflow/react) for graph rendering
- Dagre for automatic directed graph layout
- Vite for build tooling
- Deployed on GitHub Pages
